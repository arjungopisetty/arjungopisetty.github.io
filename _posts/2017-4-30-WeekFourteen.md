## What did you do this past week? ##
This past week has been pretty laid back. I've been studying hard for the upcoming test on Thursday. I'm a little worried as we've gone over 3 different languages and a bunch of different concepts, but it'll be fine. This week I've been working on my Buddhism paper. My partner and I researched a lot going into the paper, and I'm glad that it worked out in a timely matter. As far as the class went, we went over more software patterns. It is interesting learning about each iteration of the example.  

## What's in your way? ##
There's a lot of concepts to go over. Other than that, I have my other finals coming after this one. I'll need to work very efficiently this week. 

## What will you do next week? ##
As previously mentioned, I'll be focusing on finals. The final for this class will not be easy, so I'll be preparing a lot in the coming week. I'm lucky that my classes have their finals spaced out. I'll be focused on reviewing the concepts and quiz questions mainly.

## What's my experience of the class? ##
I've generally had a positive experience in this class. The quizzes were not easy, but I'm glad they are done. I've learned a lot of different concepts and technologies over the course of the semester. The outside lectures were interesting, and I'm happy that Professor Downing included them. I'm interested in the mobile area, so the talks were particularly interesting to me. 

## Tip of the week ##
Since we have been learning React for the project: http://airbnb.io/react-sketchapp//. I have not got a chance to use it personally, but it looks promising.
