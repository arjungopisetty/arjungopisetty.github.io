## What did you do this past week? ##
This past week, I've been working on Netflix problem. My partner and I have been reading up on the underlying math of the problem. Additionally, we are looking at how the caches help in leading to the solution. Outside of Software Engineering, I've been working on my Data Management homework and reading up on how APEX works. 

My mom visited this weekend and took me around Austin. Seeing family is always great during the semester and helped break the monotomy. 

## What's in your way? ##
I do not have much to complain about this week. My energy levels are back to normal and I have a good sleeping schedule again. I'm trying to stay on top of my work this semester. My partner and I have to finish the project and that will take a long time. 

## What will you do next week? ##
My primary goal is to finish the Netflix project. I'll be cooridnating with my partner to finish the project through pair programming. Exams will be coming up, so I'm going to start studying now to avoid procrastinating. I'm doing better in the class quizzes, so I'm going to review my past class notes and keep up with the reading.   

## What's my experience of the class? ##
Going well so far! I feel I'm learning important skills that I'll use in the industry, instead of theory. The Python exposure is also great, since I havent taken any other classes that taught it. Piazza is really helpful in understanding the math around the Netflix problem. I think I'm finally ok with being called on in class, even though I'd still rather not be. 

## Tip of the week ##
I found this a couple days ago: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/makegithubgreatagain/gpejlkhibgecggplgogpbgbdpnhogmhk. It's honestly not even that useful; it was just something I found kind of funny.
