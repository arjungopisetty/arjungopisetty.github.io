## What did you do this past week? ##
This past week, I've been working on Netflix problem. My partner and I have been reading up on the underlying math of the problem. Additionally, we are looking at how the caches help in leading to the solution. Outside of Software Engineering, I've been working on my Data Management homework and reading up on how APEX works. 

My mom visited this weekend and took me around Austin. Seeing family is always great during the semester and helped break the monotomy. 

## What's in your way? ##
I do not have much to complain about this week. My energy levels are back to normal and I have a good sleeping schedule again.  

## What will you do next week? ##
My primary goal is to catch up with the reading and successfully finish the Collatz project. I fell behind on some of the reading from last week and it hurt me in the daily quizzes, so I'm hoping to rectify that mistake in the next week. Besides those, I will try to remain on top of my other classes so I can focus on this one.  

## What's my experience of the class? ##
I am enjoying this class so far. It is very nerve racking to be randomly called on in class, but I am getting used to Professor Downing's style of teaching. The quizzes seem a fair assessment of how much attention you paid in class and to the readings. The piazza answers are really useful in getting through the Collatz project successfully. 

## Tip of the week ##
My tip of the week is to check out this book: https://learnpythonthehardway.org/. I originally used it to learn basic python, and am currently using it to review. For me, learning a new language does not come naturally, so having a good guide is invaluable.
