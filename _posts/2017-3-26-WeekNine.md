## What did you do this past week? ##
Coming back from break has been extremely difficult. Over break, I slept in almost everyday, so my sleep schedule is severely messed up. I've been trying to get it back to normal, and I'm hoping that it will be in the next week. In terms of software engineering, my group and I finished the first phase of IDB. I'm very grateful the everyone in my group is a talented developer, and we finished the project without too many issues. I'm hoping that the other phases of the project go smoothly as well.

## What's in your way? ##
As mentioned, I'm having some trouble getting back to a normal sleeping schedule. More tests are coming up this week, so I have to devote a lot of time into studying for those. The IDB projects will only get harder, so I need to better familiarize myself with the tools/frameworks. Additionally, I'm still dealing with some health issues that I'm hoping will resolve soon. 

## What will you do next week? ##
I want to knock out as much IBD's second phase as we can, as soon as possible. I do not want all the work to pile up. I'll be heavily studying for tests this week. 

## What's my experience of the class? ##
Although this was just the first phase in the project, my group and I encountered many ambiguities regarding the specifications. We had to rely on Piazza for most confusions. We were changing aspects up until the last day because of this. For example, one member of my group looked at websites from last year and created tables. However, Prof. Downing later stated on Piazza that it had to be grids, not tables. My group had to scramble to redo the tables into grids.
