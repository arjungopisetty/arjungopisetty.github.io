## What did you do this past week? ##
This week, my group and I worked to finish IDB2. We definitely started way too late and underestimated the scale of this phase. In the end, we got most of the specifications finished, but we need to complete some items in the next phase. This was due both in part to struggles with Google Cloud Platform (GCP), and the lack of knowledge about React and Angular 2. Looking forward, we should start working on the project earlier and work out the componenets needed early as well. Due to some medical issues, I was not able to contribute that much to this phase of the project. I'm looking to make this up in the next phase. 

Outside of SWE, my workload is increasing by the day. With finals and projects coming up, I will be really busy in the coming weeks. 

## What's in your way? ##
We have a decently sized tech debt from this phase of the project, and have all the work from the next phase of the project. This seems pretty daunting, but I'm sure we can handle it. I also have to start studying for finals, like for the one in this class. I also have a long essay to work on for my Intro to Buddhism class, and a lot of research is needed to do it. 

## What will you do next week? ##
I'll work with my group to finish the work on the project early. I'll be working diligently to make sure I make a bigger impact on this phase of the project. I'll also be studying for finals, and working on my various class projects as well. 

## What's my experience of the class? ##
The class made a hard switch from Python to SQL, which seems rather sudden to me. I appreciate that we are learning modern tools like Flask and Angular, but I'm hoping that we cover other topics in Software Engineering too. The class is decently stressful now, and it will only become more stressful with the upcoming test and project.
