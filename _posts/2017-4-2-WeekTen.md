## What did you do this past week? ##
This week has been pretty laid back. My group and I have started to plan for the second phase of the IDB project. The database and front-end components are being figured out, so I'm hoping to make progress on the implementation soon. Outside of SWE, my workload has been light too. I've been doing a lot of reading for my Intro to Buddhism class, and it's been time consuming. I'm looking forward to focusing on SWE for the following week. 

## What's in your way? ##
I have not had much in my way this past week. I'm trying to learn React for the front-end work on the application, but javascript has many quirks. I'll be focusing on that for the upcoming week. 

## What will you do next week? ##
As mentioned, I'll be focusing on React this week. Front-end design has never been a strength of mine, but I'm hoping to fix this by learning React. My group is handling much of the database work, so I'll help them out wherever I can. I'm also going to start studying for finals early. They are coming up in a month or so; I want to be ready. 

## What's my experience of the class? ##
Besides my complaints from last week, the class is going smoothly. The quizzes continue to cause me daily worries, but I'm preparing for them as well as I can. It was troubling when Professor Downing said he tries to make the questions trivial, as they don't seem trivial to me. 

## Tip of the week ##
Found this: https://opensource.google.com/. I have not been really into working on open source projects, but this looks interesting.
