## What did you do this past week? ##
This past week, my group and I started to work on the next phase of the project. Our group has been restructuring the project to incorporate React, so I'm hoping that it goes smoothly in the coming week. I'm going to be focusing on the D3.js visualization component of the website. I've done some research into the topic, and looked at the way last year's project used it. There are a lot of cool ones, but not many that fit the API our group is scraping. I'm hoping that we do not run into many issues in the coming week, as I'm going to be super busy. 

Outside of SWE, I've been trying to keep up with my other classes. The reading for Intro to Buddhism has not been that bad this week.

## What's in your way? ##
The only thing in my way is finding a D3.js visualization that will fit our project. The search has not gone so well so far, but we have a couple different candidates. Additionally, scraping the API is something else we need to nail down soon.  

## What will you do next week? ##
I'll work with my group to finish the project. I also have a test on Thursday, so I'll be studying for that whenever I can in the coming week. I'll be focused on the d3.js visual in the coming days. On top of that, I have a long paper due that I have to start researching and working on. I've also been planing out my schedule for next Fall. I'm planning on taking Big Data, Ethical Hacking, and some other filler classes. 

## What's my experience of the class? ##
Quizzes cause me a great amount of stress. It is hard to prepare for them, since they always seem to trick me in some way or another. Even by studying the material really intensely, I can still get a 0 on the quiz. I'm hoping to keep up my quiz average in the final weeks of this class. 

## Tip of the week ##
For those investing internship money: https://www.wealthfront.com/. Low-cost and automated investment service. It mostly consists of Vanguard funds, and the auto-rebalancing is nice.
