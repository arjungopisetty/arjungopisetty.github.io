## What did you do this past week? ##
This past week, I worked with my group to to finish the last phase of the IDB project. Overall, it was a good experience and helped introduce me to a lot of previously unknown technologies. We had some tech debt from phase 2 we had to tackle, but we got through it. I'm happy that the project is behind us.  

Outside of SWE, I've been trying to keep up with my other classes. I have finals coming up in all my classes, so I'll be heavily focused on those. 

## What's in your way? ##
Finals are coming up! I'll be focusing on those in the coming weeks leading up to the end of the year. I'm a bit worried since I struggled on Test 1. I'll be studying much more for this test, as well as reviewing with others from the class. I made some mistakes in studying for the last test (I expected free response questions), but hopefully knowing this will help with studying for the next test. 

## What will you do next week? ##
As previously mentioned, I'll be focusing on finals. I'm trying not to let myself become overwhelmed with studying, so I'll try and space it out as best as I can. Aside from all the work, I'm happy that the semester is coming to a close. 

## What's my experience of the class? ##
I do not really have much to add from last week. Quizzes still kill me on a weekly basis, but I'm getting through them. I learned a lot from this class, but it has been a lot of work. The subject material jumps around a lot, but it feels necessary.
