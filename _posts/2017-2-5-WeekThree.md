title: Week Three

## What did you do this past week? ##
My energy levels are back up near normal levels, so I'm really relieved about that. This week, I finished up on the Collatz project. I enjoyed solving the problem multiple ways and finding the most efficient solution. I'm going to start researching the next project today, in addition to whatever I will learn in class tomorrow. 

## What's in your way? ##
My sleep schedule is still off track, despite my best efforts to fix it. Class-wise, the Collatz project's ever-changing requirements kept me up changing small details up until the project was due. I suppose that this mirrors the nature of real software development, and has to be something I get used to over time. 

## What will you do next week? ##
My primary goal is to read up on the new project, and hopefully make some headway on the coding side. I'm a bit behind on the Javascript reading, so I have to catch up on that too. I'm doing better in the class quizzes simply by keeping up with th reading, so I have to continue that in the coming week. The work for my other classes is not too heavy. I'll be focusing most of my energy on SWE this week.   

## What's my experience of the class? ##
The project ended up taking significantly more time than I though it would. This is due to my solutions being too slow for HackerRank's tests and changes in project details. I'll try to predict the timeframe more accurately next project. The Piazza posts and optimizations given in class were helpful in successfully passing all the tests. The Bloomberg talk was educational and I really enjoyed the change in pace.
