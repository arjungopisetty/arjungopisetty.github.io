## What did you do this past week? ##
This past week, we finished up the Netflix project. I'm lucky that my partner is my roommate, so we were able to knock out most of the work quickly. I need to find a group for the next project, since my partner for the Netflix project is in the other section. Besides finishing the project, I've been reviewing the Python that we have been going over in class. Each day seems like a small addition, but all the code samples together is actually quite a bit to review.  

Outside of schoolwork, I've been trying to lead a more active lifestyle. I started jogging, but I'm not really a big fan of it so far. I'll stick with it for a bit and see how it turns out. 

## What's in your way? ##
I have two major quizzes this week, in Intro to Buddhism and Data Management. I've been studying hard trying to memorize the Buddhism vocab, but my memory is not that great. I do not see the Data Management quiz being that difficult, as the professor more or less releases the quiz questions beforehand. 

I'm hoping that my running regime will give me some much needed energy in the coming week. If that does not work, coffee will do just fine.

## What will you do next week? ##
My primary goal is successfully take both major quizzes for the week, and keep up my score in the SWE daily quizzes. I'm still reviewing for the eventual SWE test daily, and I'm hoping that the daily effort will yield good results. 

## What's my experience of the class? ##
I still think that this class has been an invaluable experience. However, the projects seem like extended coding challenges instead of real world knowledge. Both project utilized some form of a cache; I'm not quite sure if that's a true reflection of the industry, but I think it was a bit repetitive. Outside of that, the tools being used are, in my opinion, very useful for industry preparation. 

## Tip of the week ##
For anyone that uses Chrome, try Infinity New Tab. I think it is the best new tab screen, as it shows your Chrome apps with nice backgrounds. You can shift the background by clicking the bottom-right icon.
